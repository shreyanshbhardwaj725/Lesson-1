                <b class="text-warning">Football</b>is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking
                a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word
                football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports
                commonly called
                football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United
                States, and
                sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand)It is the <b class="text-warning">best sport</b>

                In 1888, the <b class="text-warning">football</b> League was founded in England, becoming the first of
                many professional football associations.
                During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most
                popular team sports in
                the world.[9]
                <b class="text-warning">The various codes of football</b> share certain common elements and can be
                grouped into two main classes of football:
                carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby
                league, where the
                ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or passed by hand, and kicking codes such as
                association
                football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is
                strictly limited.
